# cognitivemapr ![](man/figures/cognitivemapr_logo.png){align="right" width="494"}

Cognitive Mapping (CM) is a method specifically designed to study belief
systems as espoused by individuals or organisations and has several
advantages over other methods. The goal of `cognitivemapr` is to reduce
the initial investment currently needed to start using the method. The
functions in the package allow you to conduct a CM analysis similar to
that conducted in the following publication: Van Esch, Femke A.W.J.,
Snellens, Jeroen F.A. (2024). 'How to 'measure' Ideas. Introducing the
method of cognitive mapping to the domain of ideational policy studies'.
*Journal of European Public Policy*, 31(2), 428-451.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cognitivemapr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Fesch-star/cognitivemapr")
```

## Dependencies

To run the code you need to install the following packages:

-   tidyverse - built under R version 4.0.5 v ggplot2 3.3.3 v purrr
    0.3.4 v tibble 3.1.1 v dplyr 1.0.5 v tidyr 1.1.3 v stringr 1.4.0 v

-   ggraph

## Usage

Running the functions in the cognitivemapr package requires your data to
be compiled into an edge and nodelists.

-   For an instruction on the formatting requirements, see the
    'Tutorial_edge_nodelist'. This tutorial also provides an explanation
    on how to use the three functions in the package that may help you
    reformat your data.

-   For more information regarding the analytical functions in the
    package, please refer to the cognitivemapr_Tutorial.
