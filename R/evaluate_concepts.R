#' Determines the (normative) value of the nodes in a map, by running through
#' the entire map a number of times
#'
#' This function is used to determine to what extent the nodes (concepts) in a CM
#' are considered to be positive (are supported), negative (not supported) or
#' ambiguous (has positive and negative consequences) as derived from the
#' argumentation in the map. It determines the evaluation of a node (cause-concept)
#' by analysing its outgoing relations (consequent paths) taking into account the
#' initial value (positive, negative, ambiguous) of the nodes in the consequent
#' path (effect-concepts) and the sign (positive, negative, non-existent) of the
#' relation between the node (cause-concept) and the nodes in it's consequent
#' paths (effect-concepts). If a node (cause-concept) is positively linked to a
#' consequent node (effect-concept) which is valued positively (a contributes
#' positively to b and b is seen as a positive thing); then logically the node
#' (cause-concept) is also regarded as positive. A negative relation to a positive
#' consequent node (effect-concept) (a diminishes b, while b is seen as a positive
#' thing) logically leads to the conclusion that the node (cause-concept) is
#' valued negatively. A negative relation to a negatively valued node (effect-concept)
#' suggest that the cause-concept positive.
#' The function takes the dyads of nodes (cause and effect-concept) and determines
#' the value of all cause-concepts. As nodes may have multiple consequent paths,
#' that may lead to different conclusions as to the value of the cause-concept,
#' the function needs to be iterated a number of times to reach a balance and
#' derive an accurate evaluation of the nodes that takes into account all relations
#' in the map. As for cyclical maps, it is possible that no balance may be reached
#' we propose setting the diameter of the map as the maximum number of iterations
