Description: Assist in analysing cognitive maps following the method described in: 
  Van Esch and Snellens (2024) (doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2022.2155215). Makes 
  doing CM analysis more simple, time-effective and FAIR. 
  Includes functions to create and reformat simple edge and nodelists; 
  calculate the most common quantitative CM-measures; calculate the normative 
  evaluation of the concepts in the CM; calculates paradigm and instrument support 
  and creates a simple and interactive visualisation of the CM to facilitate the
  narrative analysis of CMs.
