\title{Reformats a simple edgelist and nodelist into an edgelist and nodelist that
have the required format for the cognitivemapr package}
\usage{
reformat_edge_nodelist(edgelist, nodelist)
}
\arguments{
\item{edgelist}{an edgelist}

\item{nodelist}{a nodelist,}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the resulting edgelist and nodelist
}
\description{
This function is used to reformat both a simple node and edgelist into a node
and edgelist that have the proper format to conduct all analyses in the
cognitivemapr Rpackage.
}
\details{
"from": cause concept
"to": effect concept
"weight": number of times the relation is mentioned (can have any number,
if left empty the function will set it by default to 1)
"edge_value": sign/value of the relation: can be 1 (positive relation),
-1 (negative relation), or 0 (non-existent relation). If left empty
the function will set it by default to 1 (positive)
in addition any number of columns with meta-data may be added.

It takes a nodelist with the following 4 mandatory columns:
"node_name": name of all unique concepts in an edgelist
"value": the intrisic (normative) value of the concept displayed as a number:
1 = positive/neutral, -1 = negative. You should use the negative
value sparsely as whether a concept is positive or negative is often
subjective. If a cell that is left empty in this column the function
will set it by default to 1 (positive/neutral).
"paradigms": the categorisation of the concept as belonging to/being associated
with one of two incommensurable paradigms, such as Ordoliberal
versus Keynesian. You can only distinguish two paradigms in this
column or leave the cell empty when a concept does not align with
one of these two paradigms.
"instruments": the categorisation of the concept as a particular type of
policy-instrument. You can distinguish any number of different
instruments in this column or leave the cell empty when a
concept is not a policy instrument. This column can also be
used for any other type of categorisation of the concepts that
is deemed relevant, but you cannot change the name of the column
in addition any number of columns with meta-data may be added.

The function adds id's to the nodelist and replaces the concepts in the edgelist
with id's that correspond to those in the nodelist. It reorders the columns in
the edgelist to match the requirements of the  functions in this package.
It checks whether the columns weight and edge-value in the edgelist and the
column value in the nodelist have values, and sets these values to the default
of 1 (weight = 1, edge_value = positive, (node)value = positive/neutral) if
they were left empty in the uploaded lists.
It assigns all the concepts in the edgelist the value they were given in the
nodelist (or if left empty set to the default of 1) by adding two columns to
the edgelist: value_x (value of concepts in 'from' column) and value_y (value
of concepts in 'to'  column).

It returns an edgelist and a nodelist with all the information needed
to run the functions in the cognitivemapr package in the proper order, and
retains all meta-data that was included in the original lists.

# INCOMPLETE
# Load the data

# Run the following lines of code to save the edge and nodelist
speaker_edgelist <- reformat_edge_nodelist(edgelist, nodelist)[[1]]
speaker_nodelist <- reformat_edge_nodelist(edgelist, nodelist)[[2]]
