# Contributing

We are very happy with any suggestions or contributions to improve the package. 

## How to contribute

### Issues
The easiest way to contribute is to submit an [issue](https://github.com/Fesch-star/cognitivemapr/issues), and make your comments about the software, documentation, typos or any other suggestions.

### Pull requests
If you are comfortable with git and pull requests, you can also submit a pull request where you directly suggest changes to the content. Read more about how pull requests work [here](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

In short:

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository.
3. Commit the change in that branch.
4. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub
5. Submit a pull request from that branch to the main branch of the master repository. 
6. If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.
