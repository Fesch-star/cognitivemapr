Calculates to what extent the cognitive map signals support for a set of two
commensurable policy paradigms. More specifically, it determines the saliency of all
concepts classified as aligning with one of the two paradigms which are valued
positively as determined via the evaluate_concepts function. As incommensurability
suggests that there is a zero-sum relation between the paradigms, negative valued
concepts belonging to paradigm a will be interpreted as support for paradigm b.
As such the function lists the saliency value of negatively valued concepts as
a positive score for the rival paradigm.
To be able to run this function, the functions calculate-degrees AND
evaluate_concepts should have been run first. Also the nodelist (node_measures)
list this function takes needs to contain a column with the name 'paradigms'
in which for each concept it is noted with which of the two paradigms it aligns.
If a concept does speak to either of the rival paradigms, the cell should be
left empty.
The researcher can use any rivaling set of paradigms that is relevant to
their research as long as no more or less than two are included."><title>Paradigm Support
