<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>This article will introduce the method of Cognitive Mapping (CM) as
well as the Rpackage cognitivemapr (still under development) that will
reduce the initial investment needed to start using the method. CM is a
method specifically designed to study belief systems as espoused by
individuals or organisations and has several advantages over other
methods.It starts from the premise that belief systems are best
conceived as semantic networks consisting of causal and normative
relations between ideas (Axelrod 1976; Young 1996; Yang and
González-Bailón 2017). Using visualisation techniques as well as graph
theory, CM fosters a more in depth understanding of beliefs than other
methods as it helps reveal the argumentation underlying belief systems,
makes it possible to distinguish amongst different types of beliefs
(core versus peripherical beliefs, instrumental versus paradigmatic
beliefs) as well as establish the saliency of beliefs and argumentations
(Van Esch and Snellens online first). Moreover, it allows scholars to
study the belief systems of political actors in both a qualitative and
quantitative, deductive and inductive manner. Finally, the CM technique
can be used to study beliefs embedded in texts or speech acts as well as
be used as a survey tool. It is therefore suitable to study the beliefs
of political actors and citizens in an indirect way (at-a-distance) or
by querying respondents directly (Van Esch, Joosen, and Van Zuydam
2016). To illustrate the various ways in which the technique of
Cognitive Mapping may be used, the paper will draw upon a database of
cognitive maps of <strong>European political and financial leaders and
citizens from nine EU member states regarding the Eurozone
crisis.</strong></p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="cognitive-mapping">Cognitive Mapping<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cognitive-mapping"></a>
</h2>
<p>Cognitive mapping offers scholars a standardised way of studying
ideas and has been successfully applied in the fields of political and
social psychology, communication and organizational sciences and
economics (Axelrod 1976; Bougon, Weick, and Binkhorst 1977; Boukes et
al. 2020; Laukkanen and Wang 2016; Van Esch 2012). The CM technique
rests upon the premise that ideas are reflected in spoken or written
communication like speech acts, institutional documents, media sources
and interviews. Moreover, the technique has also been used as a tool to
elicit the beliefs of individuals directly during interviews or in
survey settings. Finally, the method has been used in the context of
focus groups to elicit, study or stimulate the development of collective
belief systems (Boukes et al; Van Esch, Joosen, and Van Zuydam 2016;
Curseu et al 2010). Whereas other techniques to derive ideas from text
use concepts or themes as their unit of analysis, the basis of a
cognitive map is the relationship between the concepts (Axelrod 1976).
More specifically, to create a cognitive map all the causal and utility
relationships between concepts are derived from a text or elicited from
respondents. Utility relations are statements to the effect that concept
x is ‘good’, ‘in someone’s interest’ or ‘in the general benefit’.
Conducting a CM analysis thus reveals actors’ arguments (a leads to b)
as well as their normative evaluations (b is a worthy cause /
beneficial), and as such provides an in-depth analysis of the beliefs
and underlying argumentation embedded in texts or speech acts. In
contrast to other qualitative text analyses, the annotation of texts or
direct elicitation of responses for the CM technique is generic in the
sense that it is conducted in the same manner regardless of the topic at
hand. For the CM as a text-analysis method, detailed coding-manuals
exist, and earlier studies indicate that scholars need relatively little
training to achieve good rates of inter-coder reliability (Axelrod 1976;
Hart 1977; Young and Schafer 1998). In addition, scholars have also
researched and discussed best practices when using the direct
elicitation form of CM analysis and do’s and don’t when integrating the
method in a survey (refs). The method therefore forms a reliable
alternative to other methods used to study ideas and beliefs, and due to
its generic and structured nature may facilitate comparison across
studies and knowledge accumulation. Another added value of cognitive
mapping is that the relationships between concepts represented in a CM
may be analysed in a qualitative and quantitative manner, making the
technique useful for a wide variety of research questions. To facilitate
the coding and analysis of cognitive maps various tool and applications
are available, but requires a steep learning curve and initial
investment (Bastian, Heymann, and Jacomy 2009; Young 1996). The newly
developed R-package cognitivemapr bundles visual, qualitative and
quantitative modes of analyses.</p>

<h3 id="gathering-the-data">Gathering the data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gathering-the-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>As indicated above, cognitive map data may be obtained in two ways:
Through indirect elicitation throught the analysis of texts or
speech-acts or by direct elicitation of the data from respondents
through a survey or focus groups. The first method is common for studies
that focus on political elite, whereas the second is mostly used when
scholars are interested in the beliefs of the public of members of an
organisation.</p>
<p>The indirect method of eliciting CM data rests upon the premise that
ideas are reflected in spoken or written communication like speech acts,
institutional documents, media sources and interviews. Whereas other
techniques to derive ideas from text use concepts or themes as their
unit of analysis, the basis of a cognitive map is the relationship
between the concepts (Axelrod, 1976). More specifically, to create a
cognitive map all the causal and utility relationships between concepts
are derived from a text. Utility relations are statements to the effect
that concept x is ‘good’, ‘in someone’s interest’ or ‘in the general
benefit’. Larger (sets of) maps may benefit from a certain level of
standardisation of concepts once all relations are derived. Detailed
coding-manuals exist to guide the coding process, and earlier studies
indicate that scholars need relatively little training to achieve good
rates of intercoder reliability (Axelrod, 1976; Hart, 1977; Young &amp;
Schafer, 1998). While some attempts have been made to automate the CM
indirect coding process (Van Esch et al 2022; Young 1992), no viable
automated scheme is available yet.</p>
<p>In the case of indirect elicitation of a cognitive map, two different
procedures are available: the pairwise comparison and freehand drawing
approach. The pairwise comparison presents actors’ (leaders or citizens)
with a set of concepts and asks them to evaluate whether pairs of
concepts are causally or normatively related or not. Participants to the
research will have to review all possible combinations of the concepts
in the set (Hodgkinson et al 2004; Clarkson &amp; Hodgkinson 2005;
Markiczy &amp; Goldberg 1995). Previous studies suggest that this method
results in very comprehensive maps, but the method is also more
time-consuming and labour intensive and is seen to be tedious by
participants. In addition, Hodgkinson et all (2004) have found that
participants in their study rate representativeness of the resulting
maps as much lower than of those resulting from the freehand approach.
With the freehand approach, respondents start by choosing concepts they
deem most relevant for the topic at hand (from a predetermined list, or
inductively) and graphically draw arrows between these concepts to
represent their ideas on how these concepts relate. Participants draw
different types of arrows to represent negative or positive
relationships between concepts. This results in a cognitive map that
reflects the ideas of the respondents directly.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;In order to allow the participant to draw maps directly,
the authors developed aweb-based application was developed, DART. This
software allows respondents to draw their personal map freehand through
a user-friendly digital interface and automatically creates a digital
database of cognitive maps. The data from these maps can be linked to
the outcomes of survey questions about political and demographic
characteristics of respondents, and allows for the aggregation,
processing and analysis of data from large groups of citizens. Finally,
DART exports the survey and CM data in the formats required by other
analytical (CM) software packages like SPSS, Worldview and Gephi
(Bastian et al 2009; Young 1996).&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>To analyse this data, various quantitative measures are used.
Moreover, to facilitate qualitative or narrative analysis, the data is
often transformed into a visual graph - the cognitive map - in which the
derived concepts are depicted as points and the relations between these
concepts as arrows (Axelrod 1976; Young 1996; Young and Schafer 1998,
see <strong>figure</strong> <strong>1</strong>). Various tool and
applications are available to analyse cognitive maps, but few offer an
open-source full workflow or produce CMs that can readily be used for
qualitative analysis, several also require a steep learning curve
(Bastian, Heymann, and Jacomy 2009; Young 1996). By developing the
R-package cognitivemapr, we hope to bundle visual, qualitative and
quantitative modes of analyses to lower the threshold for scholars to
start using cognitive maps in their research.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-the-data">Preparing the data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preparing-the-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>The cognitivemapr package requires you to compile your CM data into
two csv.files with several mandatory variables included. In addition the
exact order of the mandatory columns should be maintained (except for
the value.x and value.y in the edgelist).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>An edgelist with all the relations in a cognitive map, with the
following mandatory columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“from”: containing the id of “cause”-concept</p></li>
<li><p>“to”: containing the id of the “effect”-concept</p></li>
<li><p>“edge_value”: whether the relation is positive, negative or
non-existent</p></li>
<li><p>“weight”: the number of times the (exact same) relation appears
in your data</p></li>
<li><p>“value.x”: the value of the cause (‘from’) concept: -1 =
negative, 0 = ambiguous, 1 = positive (see nodelist)</p></li>
<li><p>“value.y”: the value of the effect (‘to’) concept: -1 = negative,
0 = ambiguous, 1 = positive (see nodelist)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A nodelist with all the unique concepts a cogntive map, with the
following mandatory columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“id”: the id of the concept</p></li>
<li><p>“value”: whether the concept is inherently negative (-1),
positive (1) or ambiguous (0)<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;This should be consistent to the values (value.x /
value.y) in the edgelist. We would advise to be reticent in assigning
concepts a negative pr ambiguous value when working with a set of maps
especially when these involve different actors as the concept will be
seen as see to be inherently negative/ambiguous by all actors. Moreover,
one of the strengths of the CM analysis is that it offers ways to derive
the value of concepts per CM (see section on Evaluation below).&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>ADD INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO PREP DATA FOR PARADIGM &amp;
CATEGORY CALCS</em></strong></p>
<p>On top of these mandatory variables, you may want to add additional
information like meta-data (name of actor, date), the name of the
concepts or some kind of categorisation of the concepts for practical or
theoretical reasons. In this paper, we will use data concerning the
beliefs of the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte regarding the Eurozone
crisis as an example. You can download this data from Github by running
the following code:</p>

<p>The top 6 rows of both the edgelist and nodelist are shown below. In
addition to the mandatory columns, it shows the metadata that was
included in the edgelist. Moreover, the head of the nodelist indicates
that we also added the concept names (node_name) to facilitate
qualitative analysis and categorised the concepts in terms of economic
paradigma (eco), type of integration (int) and type of policy instrument
(instr) to conduct some theoretically interesting analyses on the data
later on in this paper (see section on categorisation below).<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;See Van Esch and Snellens first online for the

</h3>
<p>There are various ways of analysing CM data contained in the edge and
nodelist. While the full potential of the method lies in transforming
the causal and utility relations derived from text or respondents into a
graph, we will start by calculating some basic quantitative measures.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;As is shown in the calc_degree_goW function below, the
calculation of these measures actually do require you to transform the
edge and nodelist into a CM/graph (by using the ‘graph_from_data_frame’
function from the package igraph). However, as a lot more is involved to
derive a visual CM that can be analysed qualitatively and some of the
basic quantitative measures can help enhance the depth of information
included in such visualization (see visualisation section below), we
will start with the basic quantitative measures.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The basis for the analysis of CM data are the weight of relations and
the centrality (C) and saliency (S) of the concepts. The ‘weight’ of a
relation is determined by how many times an actor refers to the relation
in their texts or speech-acts and is included in the original edgelist
(see the column 3 in the edgelist above). The ‘centrality’ of a concept
is determined by establishing the number of connections of a concept
with other concepts in the map while the measure ‘saliency’ denotes the
number of connection of a concept with other concepts, but also takes
the weight of the relations into account. Whereas centrality is used in
CM analysis as a basic measure for the complexity of ideas, the weight
and saliency are indicators of how strong a particular belief is. As
complexity and strength are regarded as consequential for the effect of
ideas and beliefs on political behaviour and policy-making, these
measures may help answer important research questions in the field. In
addition, on the basis of how many relations feed into a concept
(indegree or the weighted variant weighted indegree) and how many
relations feed out from a concept (outdegree or the weighted variant
weighted outdegree), the measure ‘goal-orientation (go)’ (or its
weighted variant, gow) can be calculated. This measure provides an
indication of the extent to which a concept is seen as a cause (go(w) =
-1) or an effect (go(w) = 1) in the CM that is being analysed.</p>
<p>To calculate these basic measures, the cognitivemapr package uses
functions from the igraph packages. Although this works well, the igraph
package uses different terms for several of the measures (see table
<strong>x</strong> below).</p>

into a dataframe and combine them with the original information on the
concepts, we created the following function ‘calc_degrees_goW’.</p>

<p>Running this function using the data of Rutte shows that the function
returns a dataframe in which all the original data on the nodes in the
CM is combined with the basic measures. Running the summary shows some
basic characterising and statistical information regarding the variables
in the dataframe. This provides some first indication regarding the
number of concepts in the CM, the difference in strenght of the concepts
in the map (minimum, maximum, mean w_degree) as well as the overall
complexity of the map (mean degree) that may help compare the CM to
others.</p>

<p>In addition, the sum of saliency tells us of how many relations the
CM consists, which is the most commonly used measure of the relative
size of a CM in comparison to others.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;The sum of the saliency of all concepts is always twice
the amount of relations in a CM, as saliency counts both ‘sides’ of the

consistently as a measure of map-size dividing it by two is
superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>At the concept level, the output of the calc_degrees_goW function
also provides us with the first feel of the content of the CM. The table
below, for instance shows the top 10 concepts in terms of saliency and
economic paradigm (ordoliberal or keynesian) for the map of Rutte. The
table provides a first indication that the Dutch prime minister was
highly concerned about the Eurozone crisis, and was discussing several
institutional and predominantly ordoliberal measures to tackle the
crisis, while also debating the value of being pragmatic.</p>
